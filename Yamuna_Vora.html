<audio controls><source src="02.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>

<blockquote>Our lives are very short<br>
But why do we suffer from illusions? (<i>Maya</i>)<br>
When we die, nobody comes with us<br>
Yet we suffer from these attachments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Even those closest to our hearts (<i>Snehi</i>) stays on Earth.<br>
As much as you try to take the world with you, as much as you want to stay forever young<br>
You can't keep anything.</blockquote>

<blockquote>All your close attachments (<i>mamata</i>) <br>
You cannot take anything with you.<br>
When we die, nobody comes with us<br>
Yet we suffer from these attachments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Our attachments (<i>mamata</i>) are strung together delicately by love<br>
When we die, this delicate string of love breaks<br>
When we die, nobody comes with us<br>
Yet we suffer from these attachments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When a precious stone breaks, it loses its value and scatters everywhere.<br>
Like that, our lives ultimately fall apart.<br>
When we die, nobody comes with us<br>
Yet we suffer from these attachments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In our lives we accumulate so many things (<i>mahela</i>)<br>
But what is the point?<br>
If something suddenly happens to us<br>
What will happen to our families?</blockquote>

<blockquote>We are so worried about our loved ones, but we each much follow our own destinies!<br>
So why do we worry so much about each other?<br>
When we die, nobody comes with us<br>
Yet we suffer from these attachments.</blockquote>

But why do we suffer from illusions? (<i>Maya</i>)<br>

<h3 id="3">Like Birds Flying from a Nest</h3>
<audio controls><source src="03.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>	

<blockquote>From this world, somebody will go today, or somebody will go tomorrow<br>
Like birds flying from a nest.<br>
Everybody meets on Earth according to our past karma.<br>
From which birth we met is unknown<br>
Again we have met again to fulfill our past karma,<br>
But we bind ourselves again before we go<br>
We come and go on and on.</blockquote>


<blockquote>From this world, somebody will go today, or somebody will go tomorrow<br>
Like birds flying from a nest.<br>
But by praying to God, we will end these endless cycles.<br>
This world is illusory and transient (<i>maya</i>).<br>
Life is as passing as bubbles of soap.<br>
From this world, somebody will go today, or somebody will go tomorrow<br>
Like birds flying from a nest.</blockquote>


<blockquote>Nobody will come with us<br>
Everybody has his own path according to his past actions; everybody goes on his own road.<br>
Our relationships are as transient as clouds passing overhead<br>
From this world, somebody will go today, or somebody will go tomorrow<br>
Like birds flying from a nest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We are given this precious (<i>amulya</i>) life as human beings<br> 
So come and sing bhajans to God"<br>
These are the golden words of Shakar (the composer)<br>
From this world, somebody will go today, or somebody will go tomorrow<br>
Like birds flying from a nest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I am always thinking of you, Krishna<br>
You have helped those who believe in you<br>
In my heart I am always repeating your name<br>
Without your presence, I feel lost<br>
Every day, I am only thinking of you and want to see you.</blockquote>

I am bowing to your feet, my dear<br>
I am eagerly waiting for you to come<br>
I am always thinking of you, Krishna</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dear Shankar <i>bhagavan</i>, I am bowing to you to take away all my sorrows<br>
I am asking you for your help, and because I want to see you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>You are overlooking everyone's lives and are solving everyone's problems,<br>
And you are in my heart, too.<br>
I have a limited perspective and cannot understand your infinite intention<br>
I am asking you for your help, and because I want to see you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Your body is covered in ashes<br>
Your friends are ghosts and phantoms<br>
On your forehead there is a mark of wisdom <br>
And in your throat is poison<br>
While you have given away all your posessions.<br>
I am asking you for your help, and because I want to see you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The <i>vedas</i> say that all forms of live (<i>jiva</i>) go to you<br>
And so, too, does my heart.<br>
You are everywhere, and therefore, so am I!<br>
Give me strength (<i>shakti</i>).<br>
Have pity on me and help me be with you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We all come and go alone, I know, I know,<br>
But still, why am I so depressed?<br>
I am trying to figure out why I am so sad<br>
But I am finding no answers<br>
So please give me that understanding (<i>samjhan</i>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Give me the true perspective to see you in the entire universe (<i>shrusti</i>)<br>
My desires and heart point to you<br>
I will know peace if you come to me<br>
Have pity on me and help me be with you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Every day I do your prayers (<i>seva</i>)<br>
I am not hungry for material wealth, only for your presence, oh generous God.<br>
Please remove from me my ego<br>
Have pity on me and help me be with you.</blockquote>
