<blockquote>"The heavenly bodies are nothing but a continuous song for several voices (perceived by the intellect, not by the ear); a music which...sets landmarks in the immeasurable flow of time. It is therefore, no longer surprising that man, in imitation of his creator, has at last discovered the art of figured song, which was unknown to the ancients. Man wanted to reproduce the continuity of cosmic time...to obtain a sample test of the delight of the Divine Creator in His works, and to partake of his joy by making music in the imitation of God."</blockquote>

<p><i>The Power of Small Things</i> is Stephen Houpt's seventh studio album. The songs are inspired by nature and friendship. Stephen wrote all the music; some of the lyrics were adapted from poems by Todd Jeffries. One of the songs, "Poems in the Forest," is based on a work by the Tang-dynasty poet Tu Fu (Kenneth Rexroth's translation). "Poems in the Forest" features my friend Solvay Linde. Solvay's singing is inspiring, and it was an honor to record with her. Amy Harms, one of my favorite singers, sings beautifully on "Echoes in the Night." I play bass on tracks 2 and 6.</p>

<p><i>Light on the Mountain</i> is an album of original songs about searching, joy, nature, and love. Our style is somewhere between singer/songwriter and new age. Stephen Houpt plays Weissenborn acoustic lap steel slide guitar and sings. I play electric bass, piano (track 11), and sing (tracks 3, 6, 8). Mike Camerata plays percussion and <a href="https://cag170030.github.io/Custom-Chimes/tree.html">chime trees</a> on several tracks.

<p><i><a href="https://cag170030.github.io/Strictly-Tablue/">Strictly Tablue</a></i> is an electric blues album featuring harmonica and lead guitar. The album features former members of the Long John Hunter Blues Band and the Texas Topcats and celebrates the music of greats like Robert Johnson, T-Bone Walker, Muddy Waters, B.B.

<p><i>Search for Answers</i> is an educational project that primarily features me on electric bass. This album synthesizes my musical influences by including jazz, blues, classical, rock, and New Age compositions. Many of my talented friends are also featured on this album. Tracks 5, 10, and 14 are original compositions. I learned volumes from recording myself, writing arrangements, and leading others in the studio. The album was recorded October-December 2018 at Audio Dallas.</p>

<p><i>White Rock Lake</i> is an album of original songs, poems, and instrumentals by Stephen Houpt. Stephen plays on a 1927 Weissenborn acoustic lap steel slide guitar and a Tony Francis Weissenborn. I play electric bass on six tracks. Michelle Stroescu sings on tracks 2 and 8. Much of the album is inspired by beauty in nature and in the progression of seasons. The album also features songs about the city of Dallas. This album is relaxing, meditative, and timeless. It was recorded in the winter of 2018.</p>
