<blockquote style="font-size:13px;">
I can remember some lonesome times...I think the lonely thing is kind of born inside of a person. That's what makes him play. His soul seems to be completely some place else from other people. Lonesome feeling. My dad used to call it the blues, and I think he was right.

<blockquote style="font-size:13px;">
20th century American poet, Theodore Roethke, says in his poem "In a Dark Time,” "What is madness but nobility of soul / At odds with circumstance?” Is this not grief? Indeed, one may argue according to this definition of madness that the greatest artists have always been mad.

<blockquote style="font-size:13px;">    
If you live enough, if you love enough, if you open yourself enough to the journeys of your fellow travelers on this plane, you, too, will experience this madness. The ability to bring the essence of that madness back with you to others is perhaps the best definition of the artist.

<blockquote style="font-size:13px;">    
Humanity naturally sees the world in dichotomies. In truth, there are always more than two facets to anything, but dichotomies are inherent in our being. We often learn to define things by their opposites, and by their opposite-ness. Right and left, forward and backward, up and down, male and female, day and night, light and dark, heat or cold, present or absent, war and peace, alive or dead, together and alone, here and there, black or white, me and you. Interestingly, the scariest place to be is between the extremes of our dichotomies. This is where grief lives. This is a vulnerable place precisely because it is not surety. And this is where humanity exists. From this place comes the cosmologies and faiths, philosophies and curiosities, arts and sciences of our race. This is where creativity is born, amid our angst and courage and brokenness and healing and mystery. Perhaps even you are there, waiting for you.

...And incidentally, my friend, this is also the heart of blues.
