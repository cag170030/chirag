<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This project is a celebration of one of my largest areas of growth in college: learning the guitar. Much of this project speaks to the question,
“How does the guitar, an ancient, multicultural instrument, interpret jazz, a novel, fundamentally American art form?” A holistic answer is sought from three angles: (1) reflecting on my study of classical guitar (and other pre-jazz genres), (2) creatively arranging jazz standards, and (3) performing these arrangements.</p>

<p>The guitar is perhaps the most historically significant and ubiquitous instrument across cultures. When guitarists interpret contemporary music, they are bridging the eastern and western musical diasporas, as well as the past to the present. As a first-generation American, this project is of deep personal interest. While primarily exploring how the guitar interprets jazz, this project also sheds light on smaller, more personal questions: “How did the 20th and 21st century’s most notable jazz guitarists lead their lives?” “From where did they draw their musical inspiration?” “How did they balance their various cultural and professional identities in the composition and playing of this norm-defying music?”</p>

<h3 id="Background">Background</h3>

<p>I was drawn to the guitar from an early age, largely due to my pre-school
Spanish teacher Ms. María. She played a beautiful, yellow-golden classical guitar with nylon strings. I remember how magical it was to watch her effortlessly strum the strings. Unfortunately, my father refused to buy me a guitar at age 3, and my musical origins instead took root on piano.</p>

<p>My childhood was devoted to learning piano and bass guitar. When I began college, I was proficient at these instruments but felt that my heart was elsewhere. I first seriously laid my hands on a guitar in the fall of 2017 and immediately fell in love. That summer, I had been listening to the virtuosic guitarist Joe Pass and was determined to replicate his sounds. I figured out a few jazz voicings on my roommate’s acoustic guitar and learned how to “walk” a bassline while playing accompanying chords.</p>

<p>I enrolled in Prof. James Wilder’s <i>Guitar I</i> course the following summer, where I gained dexterity and finger independence and grew more comfortable playing solo. I also enjoyed learning about the cultural aspects of the guitar--its history, pedagogy, and evolution. I continued this journey by taking Dr. Madriguera’s <i>Guitar II</i> and <i>Guitar Ensemble</i> courses the following fall and spring. By the end of the spring 2019 semester, I began to feel more confident expressing myself on guitar.</p>

<p>Then, my guitar journey took a wonderful turn: overseas. I <a href="http://chiragokani.org/spain2019.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">traveled to Spain</a> with members of the UTD Guitar Ensemble to study classical guitar for two weeks. I treasure every moment of this experience. Spain is the birthplace of the modern classical guitar, and I learned so much about the history and building of the instrument while there. I also learned a lot about playing guitar in different contexts (solo, band, ensemble, duet, etc.). I made such wonderful friends in Spain (and am still in touch with them today) and enjoyed many late-night jam sessions.</p>

<p>When the COVID crisis materialized in the spring of 2020, I was forced to give up playing bass in various DFW-area bands and jazz groups. With nobody to play with, I felt my motivation shift away the bass to the guitar. Over the next several months, my guitar skills sharpened tremendously. I developed my own right-hand technique, inspired by George Benson. My comfort with bebop vocabulary grew, and I taught myself many new voicings. I also explored blues guitar during this time and recorded a collection of songs called “<a href="https://youtu.be/XWMpEVDimcM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blues in June</a>” Towards the end of the summer, I was also growing competent with other styles of guitar, including playing in open tunings (which resulted in the project “<a href="http://chiragokani.org/friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ode to Friends</a>”) and <a href="https://youtu.be/8HGFOxEV5R4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">playing lap-style</a>, like my friend Stephen Houpt.</p>

<h3 id="Finding_My_Voice">Finding My Voice</h3>
   
<p>Every great guitarist has a unique voice. Django Reinhardt's sound is known for a sharp attack, tremelo picking, and minor 6 voicings. B.B. King's sound is easily recognized by glissandos, bold entrances, and vibrato. George Benson's sound is defined by fast bebop lines, a dark tone (produced a combination of his rest stroke technique and use of flatwound strings), and energetic scat singing.</p>
	
<p>In 2018-2019, I struggled to find my voice on guitar, frustrating me and almost convincing me to give up the instrument altogether. The main source of this frustration was an unsatisfactory right-hand technique. I felt lost between options: playing with classical technique, playing with a pick, playing with my thumb, playing with fingerpicks, etc. Since I did not own a guitar at that time, I was further confused by trying to decide which type of guitar I should pursue: classical nylon-string guitar, acoustic steel-string guitar, electric guitar, archtop jazz guitar, etc.</p>
	
<p>Playing primarily with my thumb (in the style of George Benson) while retaining some aspects of classical technique (using <i>P</i>, <i>I</i>, <i>M</i>, and <i>A</i>) ended up being the most comfortable technique for me. Once I committed to this technique in March 2020, my vocabulary on guitar expanded. I liked this technique because it allowed me to play a variety of styles with minimal technical adjustments. I could go between playing a bossa nova accompaniment and soloing without having to switch to pick, for example.</p>	
	
<p>But I remained undecided about which type of guitar to pursue. In spring and summer of 2020, I was borrowing my friend Roma's acoustic guitar, but I wanted to sound more like George Benson and Bireli Lagrene by playing an archtop jazz guitar. My friend Tim Hicks kindly lent me his Ibanez Artcore guitar, on which I strung flatwound strings. I enjoyed the mellow, jazzy sound, but I felt unsatisfied by the guitar's limitations. Folk and bossa nova music, for example, sounded out-of-place on the electric instrument. </p>		
	
<p>After much deliberation, I was finally convinced to pursue acoustic guitar by my friend Stephen Houpt. Stephen saw my potential in the acoustic instrument, but I think he was also tired of my indecisiveness. In November 2020, I bought my own acoustic guitar: a Canadian-made Seagull Artist Mosaic guitar. It has a beautiful cedar top, and the body and neck is fully carved wood. Equipped with a comfortable technique and a high-quality guitar, my voice quickly became defined by blues inflections, bebop vocabulary, folk articulations, and fusion-inspired chords.</p>
	
<p>A musical voice transcends technique and instrument choice: it is also defined by repeated musical thoughts, which one may call “musical character.” This “character” is something of a sum of our many influences. I discuss a few of my influences below.</p>
	
<p>Charlie Byrd</p>

You can hear Joe Pass playing the exact same line on several records. It works well as a tag but can be used as a line to play over dominant chords.</p>

<p>Sometimes I borrow ideas from pianists. This line is one I picked up from Kelly Durbin's playing. It works well over dominant and diminished chords.</p>

<p>I did not own a guitar until a months before I began this project. So almost everything I have learned was on the guitars of my generous friends: Roma, Michelle, Christian, Evan, Ben, Cameron, Stephanie, Dany, Mikey, Nathan, Benji, and Ella. Thank you!</p>

<p>Thanks to Dr. Madriguera for providing timely and constructive feedback on my playing via email, and for supporting me on the associated independent study. Thanks also to Prof. Wilder, my teachers in Spain, and, of course, Mrs. María, my first musical hero.</p>

<p>Thanks to the amazing friends I have made along the way: Dany, Mikey, Nathan, Leo, Jesús, Finn, Holly, Solvay. I never knew I would meet people like you when I came to UTD. I wish I had known you from the beginning.</p>

I can remember some lonesome times...I think the lonely thing is kind of born inside of a person. That's what makes him play. His soul seems to be completely some place else from other people. Lonesome feeling. My dad used to call it the blues, and I think he was right.
