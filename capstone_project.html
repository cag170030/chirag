<blockquote style="font-size:13px;">
I can remember some lonesome times...I think the lonely thing is kind of born inside of a person. That's what makes him play. His soul seems to be completely some place else from other people. Lonesome feeling. My dad used to call it the blues, and I think he was right.

<blockquote style="font-size:13px;">
20th century American poet, Theodore Roethke, says in his poem "In a Dark Time,” "What is madness but nobility of soul / At odds with circumstance?” Is this not grief? Indeed, one may argue according to this definition of madness that the greatest artists have always been mad.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="font-size:13px;">    
If you live enough, if you love enough, if you open yourself enough to the journeys of your fellow travelers on this plane, you, too, will experience this madness. The ability to bring the essence of that madness back with you to others is perhaps the best definition of the artist.

<blockquote style="font-size:13px;">    
Humanity naturally sees the world in dichotomies. In truth, there are always more than two facets to anything, but dichotomies are inherent in our being. We often learn to define things by their opposites, and by their opposite-ness. Right and left, forward and backward, up and down, male and female, day and night, light and dark, heat or cold, present or absent, war and peace, alive or dead, together and alone, here and there, black or white, me and you. Interestingly, the scariest place to be is between the extremes of our dichotomies. This is where grief lives. This is a vulnerable place precisely because it is not surety. And this is where humanity exists. From this place comes the cosmologies and faiths, philosophies and curiosities, arts and sciences of our race. This is where creativity is born, amid our angst and courage and brokenness and healing and mystery. Perhaps even you are there, waiting for you.

...And incidentally, my friend, this is also the heart of blues.

The best advice I have to offer is that if you love playing music for yourself, all the time you spend is worth it.</blockquote>

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This project is a celebration of one of my largest area of growth in college: learning the guitar. Much of this project speaks to the question,
“How does the guitar, an ancient, multicultural instrument, interpret jazz, a novel, fundamentally American art form?” A holistic answer is sought from three angles: (1) reflecting on my study of classical guitar (and other pre-jazz genres) (2) creatively arranging jazz standards, and (3) performing these arrangements.</p>

<p>The guitar is perhaps the most historically significant and ubiquitous instrument across cultures. When guitarists interpret contemporary music, they are bridging the eastern and western musical diasporas, as well as the past to the present. As a first-generation American, this project is of deep personal interest. While primarily exploring how the guitar interprets jazz, this project also sheds light on smaller, more personal questions: “How did the 20th and 21st century’s most notable jazz guitarists lead their lives?” “From where did they draw their musical inspiration?” “How did they balance their various cultural and professional identities in the composition and playing of this norm-defying music?”</p>

<h3 id="Background">Background</h3>

<p>I was drawn to the guitar from an early age, largely due to my pre-school
Spanish teacher Ms. María. She played a beautiful, yellow-golden classical guitar with nylon strings. I remember how magical it was to watch her effortlessly strum the strings. Unfortunately, my father refused to buy me a guitar at age 3, and my musical origins instead took root on piano.</p>

<p>My childhood was devoted to learning piano and bass guitar. When I began college, I was proficient at these instruments but felt that my heart was elsewhere. I first seriously laid my hands on a guitar in the fall of 2017 and immediately fell in love. That summer, I had been listening to the virtuosic guitarist Joe Pass and was determined to be able to replicate his sounds. I figured out a few jazz voicings on my roommate’s acoustic guitar and learned how to “walk” a bassline while playing accompanying chords.</p>

<p>I enrolled in Prof. James Wilder’s Guitar I course the following summer, in which I gained dexterity and finger independence and grew more comfortable playing solo. I also enjoyed learning about the cultural aspects of the guitar--its history, pedagogy, and evolution. I continued this journey by enrolling in Dr. Madriguera’s Guitar II and Guitar Ensemble courses the following fall and spring. By the end of the spring 2019 semester, I began to feel more confident expressing myself on guitar.</p>

<p>Then, my guitar journey took a wonderful turn: overseas. I traveled to Spain with members of the UTD Guitar Ensemble to study classical guitar for two weeks. I treasure every moment of this experience. Spain is the birthplace of the modern classical guitar, and I learned so much about the history and building of the instrument while there. I also learned a lot about playing guitar in different contexts (solo, band, ensemble, duet, etc.). I made such wonderful friends in Spain (and am still in touch with them today) and enjoyed many late-night jam sessions.</p>

<p>When the COVID crisis materialized in the spring of 2020, I was forced to give up playing bass in various DFW-area bands and jazz groups. With nobody to play with, I felt my motivation shift away the bass to the guitar. Over the next several months, my guitar skills sharpened tremendously. I developed my own right-hand technique, inspired by George Benson. My comfort with bebop vocabulary grew, and I taught myself many new voicings. I also explored blues guitar during this time and recorded a collection of songs called “<a href="https://youtu.be/XWMpEVDimcM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blues in June</a>” Towards the end of the summer, I was also growing competent with other styles of guitar, including playing in open tunings (which resulted in the project “<a href="http://chiragokani.org/friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ode to Friends</a>”) and <a href="https://youtu.be/8HGFOxEV5R4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">playing lap-style</a>, like my friend Stephen Houpt.</p>

<p>I did not own a guitar until a months before I began this project. So almost everything I have learned was on the guitars of my generous friends: Roma, Michelle, Christian, Evan, Ben, Cameron, Stephanie, Dany, Mikey, Nathan, Benji, and Ella. Thank you!</p>

<p>Thanks to Dr. Madriguera for providing timely and constructive feedback on my playing via email, and for supporting me on the associated independent study. Thanks also to Prof. Wilder, my teachers in Spain, and, of course, Mrs. María, my first musical hero.</p>

<p>Thanks to the amazing friends I have made along the way: Dany, Mikey, Nathan, Leo, Jesús, Finn, Holly, Solvay. I never knew I would meet people like you when I came to UTD. I wish I had known you from the beginning.</p>
