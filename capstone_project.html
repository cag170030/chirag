I wonder if perhaps there is genuine value in also considering grief. The value is not, as some might submit, in a presumed increase of accuracy in understanding humanity by tempering optimism. Indeed, I find it interesting that optimists often identify as optimists, while pessimists often identify as realists. No, rather the value in considering grief is what it may teach of hope, among other aspects of life. Hope does not exist without grief; rather, it is grief defines hope. Hope without the possibility of grief is simply happiness. Even happiness in the presence of grief is not hope if the two are not mingled. 
<blockquote style="font-size:13px;">
Grief is also the gift at the heart of the restlessness that fuels our creativity. It is the sand that produces the pearl, that inescapable dis-ease that elicits our beauty because we are forced to wrestle with it.

<blockquote style="font-size:13px;">
Plato offered, “We are fired into life with a madness that comes from the gods and has us believe that we can achieve a great embrace, make ourselves immortal, and contemplate the divine.” Madness. A madness that comes from the gods fires us.

<blockquote style="font-size:13px;">
20th century American poet, Theodore Roethke, says in his poem ”In a Dark Time,” ”What is madness but nobility of soul / At odds with circumstance?” Is this not grief? Indeed, one may argue according to this definition of madness that the greatest artists have always been mad.
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="font-size:13px;">    
If you live enough, if you love enough, if you open yourself enough to the journeys of your fellow travelers on this plane, you, too, will experience this madness. The ability to bring the essence of that madness back with you to others is perhaps the best definition of the artist.

<blockquote style="font-size:13px;">    
Humanity naturally sees the world in dichotomies. In truth, there are always more than two facets to anything, but dichotomies are inherent in our being. We often learn to define things by their opposites, and by their opposite-ness. Right and left, forward and backward, up and down, male and female, day and night, light and dark, heat or cold, present or absent, war and peace, alive or dead, together and alone, here and there, black or white, me and you. Interestingly, the scariest place to be is between the extremes of our dichotomies. This is where grief lives. This is a vulnerable place precisely because it is not surety. And this is where humanity exists. From this place comes the cosmologies and faiths, philosophies and curiosities, arts and sciences of our race. This is where creativity is born, amid our angst and courage and brokenness and healing and mystery. Perhaps even you are there, waiting for you.

Grief, then, may be one of the many keys to unlocking our existence.

<blockquote style="font-size:13px;">    
The 18th century statesman and writer, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, tells us in his poem “The Holy Longing,”: 
    <br>
<blockquote>
    And so long as you haven't experienced this:
<br>
    To die, and so to grow,
<br>
    You are only a troubled guest
<br>
    On the dark earth.
