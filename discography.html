<p><i>Search for Answers</i> is an educational project that primarily features me on electric bass. This album synthesizes my musical influences by including jazz, blues, classical, rock, and New Age compositions. Many of my talented friends are also featured on this album. Tracks 5, 10, and 14 are original compositions. I learned volumes from recording myself, writing arrangements, and leading others in the studio. The album was recorded October-December 2018 at Audio Dallas.</p>

<p><i>White Rock Lake</i> is an album of original songs, poems, and instrumentals by Stephen Houpt. Stephen plays on a 1927 Weissenborn acoustic lap steel slide guitar and a Tony Francis Weissenborn. I play electric bass on six tracks. Michelle Stroescu sings on tracks 2 and 8. Much of the album is inspired by beauty in nature and in the progression of seasons. The album also features songs about the city of Dallas. This album is relaxing, meditative, and timeless. It was recorded in the winter of 2018.</p>
