<p>I am a second-year Eugene McDermott Scholar at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I am pursuing a B.S. in Physics.</p>
 
<p>My activities are largely governed by my passion for astronomy and music. As a member of the Society of Physics Students, I help coordinate public star parties and attend weekly meetings to discuss astrophyical research. I have been mentored by Dr. Michael Kesden and Dr. Kaloyan Penev and currently conduct my own informal research. I am also an electric bassist and have recently grown increasingly active in the Dallas music scene.</p>

<p>I am confident that some form of teaching will become central to my professional life. My service as a branch manager for <a href="https://www.intellichoice.org/"> IntelliChoice</a> (a free math tutoring organization) and as an assistant for technology classes at the <a href="https://www.cor.net/departments/public-library"> Richardson Public Library</a> has led me to view teaching as an opportunity to impart the skills and values needed to succeed as a leader in an increasingly quantitative and automated world. I will continue to share the beauties of astronomy and music to ignite the curiosity, sense of awe, and capacity to wonder in my audiences.</p>

<p>You can read more about my recent activities on the <a href="https://mcdermottscholars.wordpress.com/2018/11/15/another-fall-another-spring/"> McDermott Scholars' Blog</a>.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Music</h3>

<p>I regularly perform with the <a href="http://www.crosswindsjazz.com/">Crosswinds Jazz Band</a>, blues/world musician <a href="http://www.stephenhoupt.com/">Stephen Houpt</a>, and <a href="https://cag170030.github.io/Addis/"> Addis</a>, a jazz/fusion/world group. I occasionally sit in with the St. Mark's Blues Club, a charity-based blues band I played in and led as a high school student. I also play in a jazz combo hosted by the <a href="http://helbingjazzinitiative.com/"> Helbing Jazz Initiative</a> under the direction of bassist James Driscoll and am the bassist for the UTD Pep Band. I study privately with Chris Hicks (master's student in Jazz Composition at UT-Arlington) and have previously studied with <a href="https://mentis.uta.edu/explore/profile/brian-mulholland">Brian Mulholland</a>.</p>

<p>I am currently recording a demo album primarily featuring solo bass. It will be available for download on this website soon.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Sonifications</h3>  

<blockquote>
"'What is this great and pleasing sound that fills my ears?' I asked. 'That,' replied my grandfather, 'is a concord of tones separated by unequal but nevertheless carefully proportioned intervals, caused by the rapid motion of the spheres themselves. The high and low tones blended together produce different harmonies...[The] outermost sphere, the star-bearer, with its swifter motion, gives forth a higher-pithed tone, whereas the lunar sphere, the lowest, has the deepest tone.'"</blockquote>
