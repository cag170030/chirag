<p>I am a third-year Eugene McDermott Scholar at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I am pursuing a B.S. in Physics.</p>
 
<p>My activities are largely governed by my passion for astronomy and music. I have gained exposure to astrophysics and fluid dynamics as an undergraduate research assistant. I am also an electric and upright bassist and am active in the Dallas music scene.</p>

<p>I am confident that some form of teaching and performance will become central to my professional life. My service as a branch manager for <a href="https://www.intellichoice.org/"> IntelliChoice</a> (a free math tutoring organization) and as an assistant for technology classes at the <a href="https://www.cor.net/departments/public-library"> Richardson Public Library</a> has led me to view teaching as an opportunity to impart the skills and values needed to succeed as a leader and individual in an increasingly quantitative and automated world. I will continue to share the beauties of astronomy and music to ignite the curiosity, sense of awe, and capacity to wonder in my audiences.</p>
