<p>I am a second-year Eugene McDermott Scholar at the University of Texas at Dallas studying physics. With an interest in astronomy, I assist Dr. Kaloyan Penev in developing software for citizen scientists to perform high-precision photometry and participate in UTD's chapter of the Society of Physics Students by organizing star parties. I concurrently pursue my interest in music as an electric bassist.</p>

<p>I trace my love for both astronomy and music back to my twelve years at St. Mark's School of Texas. During my senior year, I studied astronomy and planetarium operations with Dr. Steve Balog, Cecil H. and Ida Green Master Teaching Chair in Science and Director of the Planetarium and Observatory, visiting the McDonald Observatory and presenting several shows to large audiences. I also played bass for the St. Mark's Jazz, Blues, Pep, and Concert Bands, the Greater Dallas Youth Orchestra's advanced jazz combo, and the TPSMEA All-State Jazz Band '15-'17.</p>

<p>While I am unsure of the extent to which my career will synthesize astronomy and music, I am confident that some form of teaching will become central to my professional life. My service as a branch manager for <a href="https://www.intellichoice.org/"> IntelliChoice</a>.(a free math tutoring organization) and as an assistant for technology classes at the <a href="https://www.cor.net/departments/public-library"> Richardson Public Library</a> has led me to view teaching as an opportunity to impart the skills and values needed to succeed as a leader in an increasingly quantitative and automated world. I will continue to share the beauties of astronomy and music to ignite the curiosity, sense of awe, and capacity to wonder in my audiences.</p>


<h2 align="middle">Music</h2>

<p>I play regularly with the Crosswinds Jazz Band, Stephen Houpt, and Addis (a jazz/fusion/world group). I occasionally sit in with the St. Mark's Blues Club, a charity-based blues band I played in and led as a high school student. I also play in a jazz combo hosted by the <a href="http://helbingjazzinitiative.com/"> Helbing Jazz Initiative</a> under the direction of bassist James Driscoll. I study privately with Chris Hicks (master's student in Jazz Composition at UT-Arlington) and have previously studied with Brian Mulholland.</p>

<p>I am currently recording a demo album primarily featuring solo bass. It will be available for download on this website in mid- late-November.</p>

<blockquote>
"'What is this great and pleasing sound that fills my ears?' I asked. 'That,' replied my grandfather, 'is a concord of tones separated by unequal but nevertheless carefully proportioned intervals, caused by the rapid motion of the spheres themselves. The high and low tones blended together produce different harmonies...[The] outermost sphere, the star-bearer, with its swifter motion, gives forth a higher-pithed tone, whereas the lunar sphere, the lowest, has the deepest tone.'"</blockquote>
