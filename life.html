<p>Thanks to these people for helping me "find my voice": </p>

<p>Here are some songs where I think you can really hear my own "voice."</p>  
  
<h4>1. Almost Home</h4>
	
<h4><audio controls><source src="Almost Home.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></h4>

<p>From <i>The Sounds of the Great Smoky Mountains</i>, a CD I grew up listening to.</p>	
			

				
  
  
<h4>2. Searching</h4>
	
<h4><audio controls><source src="10 Searching.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></h4>

<p>Stephen plays the Weissenborn guitar on this. This song is about friendship: what I thought it was about before college vs. what came out of college knowing. It reminds me of Briana, Leo, Brian J., and Anna S.</p>	
		
    
<h4>3. Heaven and Hell</h4>
	
<h4><audio controls><source src="heaven_hell.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></h4>

<p>Vangelis's theme "Heaven and Hell," which reminds me of all the people who look at the universe with wonder: Dr. Gartstein, Mr. Hoehn, Dr. Balog, Victor Wooten, Iver, Ariel, etc.</p>	    
    
  
<h4>4. Ask the Mountains</h4>
	
<h4><audio controls><source src="Ask the Mountains.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></h4>

<p>Vangelis's "Ask the Mountains"...you can tell how much Vangelis helped me see into myself. This song is about Mother Nature, which always loves you back.</p>	  
  
  
<h4>5. Forgotten Love</h4>
	
<h4><audio controls><source src="forgotten.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></h4>

<p>Jaco Pastorius's "Forgotten Love," which I transcribed and played using MIDI patches for Kelly Durbin. I think you can feel the spirit of music in the flute part, which is not in Jaco's original recording, around 1:00. This reminds me of Alexis, Havi, Anja, Patricia, and Emma. </p>	    
    
	
<h4>6. Song of the Seas</h4>
	
<h4><audio controls><source src="song_seas.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></h4>

<p>"Song of the Seas," a theme by Vangelis. This song reminds me of India, Nani, Mom, Alexis, Zach, Anja, Ms. Norman</p>
