<h2 align="center">Solid-Bar Wind Chimes</h2>
<h4 align="center">2000–7000 Hz</h4>
<p>Solid-bar wind chimes are the highest-pitch and lightest-weight chimes I make. They ring freely in gentle breezes and produce an unobtrusive, ambient sound that offers the same harmonic span as larger chimes (with perhaps more timbral richness).</p>

<p><i>Chirag's wind chimes hang outside on my balcony and make me grateful every time there's a breeze--they are lovely to listen to, with a gentle and clear sound, and I have received compliments from numerous neighbors looking for a set. I keep them next to my hammock on the balcony and it is truly a peaceful happy place to sit!</i><p>
