<blockquote>
"'What is this great and pleasing sound that fills my ears?' I asked. 'That,' replied my grandfather, 'is a concord of tones separated by unequal but nevertheless carefully proportioned intervals, caused by the rapid motion of the spheres themselves. The high and low tones blended together produce different harmonies...[The] outermost sphere, the star-bearer, with its swifter motion, gives forth a higher-pithed tone, whereas the lunar sphere, the lowest, has the deepest tone.'"</blockquote>

<p>This is a continually updated "sound journal," a place where I keep record of thought-provoking auditory experiences.</p>
