Om
By the grace of God || Jai Sai Baba
Sri Ram
<br>

On Saturday, August 18th, 1990, at 12:30 a.m., we began our pilgrimege of <i>chardham</i> (four holy destinations north India).
	
<br>
	
Before leaving Bhavnagar we received Hanuman's <i>dharshan</i> blessings with the sacrificial coconut. The ceremony was done by the coordinator of our trip. The bus was decorated with garlands and flowers, and we were bid farewell with firecrackers and photographs. We began with the chanting of God's name, as well as some bhajans. The bus was comfortable, and the road was very smooth. In the morning, at 8:00 a.m. we reached Shamlaji and we visited the main temple. Then, at 9:00 a.m., we began again. We reached Udaypoor at 2:00 p.m., and we arrived at the dormitory and had lunch. We enjoyed the chanting and singing while on the bus. At 8:30 p.m. we arrived at Nathvara (Srinadji). There was lots of rain. We reached at night and performed prayers in the morning. That night was the new moon (chaitra). In the afternoon, we went shopping. We then had lunch and left for the Pushkar (Brahma) temple. We stayed overnight there. We took a dip in the holy lake of Pushkar and remembered all of of our relatives, including our son, daughters, and in-laws, and also our ancestors. The lake is very beautiful. We received blessings of Brahma. In all of India, this is the only temple where Brahma is worshipped. The town of Pushkar is very small and many Marvadis perform pilgrimege here. It is very important to immerse oneself in this lake. Vallabhacharya (Mahaprabhuji) has a permanent place here. We were headed to go to Ajmer this evening. It is a lot of fun to shop in Rajastan, but since there was not enough time, we enjoyed window-shopping from our bus. We saw the Muslim shrine of Khwajapeer and received blessings. We stopped for snacks and tea and arrived at Jaipur at 8:00 p.m. After dinner, we went to see a movie in Jaipur. We went to this specific theater because it has 3500 lights and royal carvings and architecture. Then after our morning routine we went by bus to see the city of Jaipur. The theater's name was Rajmandir. It was a majestic theater worth seeing. We saw the movie <i>Mehne pyar kia</i>. The next day after breakfast we left got on the bus to sightsee. 
	
	1) Birla mandir of Lakshminarayan
	2) Havaamahel (Wind palace), seen from the bus
	3) Bura Keela (big fort)

From there we saw the tie-die printing factory. Then we saw a museum. From the bus we saw rajmahel (the king's palace). Then we got off the bus. The king's and queen's dresses were worth seeing. The king's weapons were also worth seeing. The king's gown was huge! The king was 7 feet tall! The guide explained everything to us. The king's sword was also very heavy. We were awe-struck by looking at all of these things. Then we returned to our hotel. Then we went shopping. There wasn't much time, but we bought the famous decorative shoes, as these are popular from this area. Because it was dark, we couldn't see everything. The bedspreads are also very good from this area. Because of shortage of time, we could not go through the whole market. From Jaipur we arrived at Agra. We saw the Taj Mahal and took pictures. We did some more sightseeing. Then we arrived at Mathura. We stayed at the Swaminarayan temple in Mathura. In Mathura we worshipped the Yamuna river from its banks. We bowed to Vallabhacharya's famous throne. In the evening we went to Jathipura, which is where Srinaji appeared and lifted a mountain to protect the local people (Govindan Paarvath).
