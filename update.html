<p>Dear friends & family,</p>

<p>I hope this message finds you well! As we experience this challenging time together (and yet apart), I want to keep you posted with those things that are continuing to fill my days with meaning.</p>
	
<p>The legendary physicist Richard Feynman famously asked his Caltech students to formulate one simple sentence to be passed on to the future of humanity, provided that all other knowledge is forever lost. Of course, there can't possibly be a "right answer" to this question; I think the intention of the exercise is instead to identify something that characterizes "Truth." </p>
	
<p>Feynman's answer: "The universe is made of atoms."</p>
	
<p>I have been posing Feynman's question to friends. I have found everyone's responses to be deeply meaningful. Some of my favorites have been "Walk slowly; drink lots of water" (Parker), "Joy and hope are a choice" (Anna), and <i>Ecclesia semper reformanda est</i> or "The church must always be reformed" (Emma).</p>
	
<p>The diversity of these responses reminds me that "Truth" is approximately the "sum" of many a large number of these kinds of sentences, and that each of these sentences is imbued with "Truth." In the language of linear algebra, it's as if each sentence is a basis vector in the "Truth"-space. In the language of music, it's as if each sentence is a note in a scale. In the language of quantum mechanics, it's as if each sentence is the eigenstate of a Hermitian operator. 
	
<p>The more responses I hear to Feynman's question, </p>	
	
<p>If the "sum" of these sentences approaximates "Truth," then "Truth" is <i>exactly</i> the "integral" over an infinite number of these kinds of sentences.  </p>
